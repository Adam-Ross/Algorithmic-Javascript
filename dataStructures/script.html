      <h1>Script ideas:</h1>
      <h3>Better that he cannot go outside, no need to be a dream.</h3>
      <p>I think it would be better for the lead to basically be a person that is kept indoors from some unknown terror that might be lurking outside.  IE I am legend or some shit like that.</p>
      <h3>Reasons for this</h3>
      <p>What we are trying to do is build atmosphere - isolation is an atmosphere that goes a long ways.</p>
      <h1>Sequence:</h1>
      <h3>quick rundown of ideas.</h3>
      <p>Guy comes running into front door, panting, like he has been running away from something.  He basically jumps to safety into the house, and we can sound design some menacing sounds that are coming from the outside of the house.</p>
      <p>The guy is nagged by the voices outside, that are reasonable / menacing.  They keep pleading for him to come out, and basically try to get in his head.</p>
      <h3>So why would he go outside?</h3>
      <p>Bascially, when we start off we catch him coming home from some mission that he has had, he had to procure something, maybe medicine to where he would have to leave the house.</p>
      <p>But alas, he has left something behind in his truck, and this is where the conflict comes from - he knows that he is going to have to go back out to his truck to get it, but he knows that if he does, he will have to fight for his life.</p>
      <h1>Sequence:</h1>
      <p>We see him going on about his business during the day - he works out, cooks, tries to keep his mind off what is going on outside.  But, the voices outside come in and out and ask him about what he is doing, and try to coax him into going outside.</p>
